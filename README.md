# Average Seek Time of Some Disk Scheduling Algorithms

## :cd: About :cd:
This program was a project from my Operating Systems class. It calculates the average seek time for the following disk scheduling algorithms:
* First Come First Seeked **(FCFS)**
* Shortest Seek First **(SSF)**
* Elevator **(SCAN)**
* Circular SCAN **(CSCAN)**
